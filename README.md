Mission Statement

This repository stands as living proof that a man or woman can reclaim their rights, rebut fraudulent claims, and secure their property through lawful affidavits and public record.

It exists as both record and template: a demonstration of how to anchor truth across private affidavit, blockchain/IPFS, GitHub, and county filings.

The goal is simple:
	â€¢	To show that fraud cannot stand against unrebutted truth.
	â€¢	To provide others with the tools to follow this process.
	â€¢	To restore common law and trust jurisdiction above corporate fictions.

This is not theory. This is practice. This is record.
